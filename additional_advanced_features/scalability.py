# Example using Dask for parallel computing
import dask.dataframe as dd

def parallel_processing(dataframe_path):
    # Read the data into a Dask DataFrame
    df = dd.read_csv(dataframe_path)
    
    # Perform operations in parallel
    mean_price = df['price'].mean().compute()
    
    return mean_price

# TODO: Implement other distributed computing solutions like Spark for scalability.
