# Trading Algorithm Project

## Overview

This project is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for developing a trading algorithm. The project is divided into several layers, each responsible for specific functionalities ranging from data collection to monitoring and maintenance.

## Layers

1. **Data Collection Layer**: Collects real-time market data, historical data, and news & social media feeds.
2. **Data Preprocessing Layer**: Cleans the data and prepares it for machine learning models.
3. **Data Storage Layer**: Stores the data for easy retrieval and further analysis.
4. **Algorithm Training Layer**: Includes model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and backtesting.
5. **Algorithm Execution Layer**: Generates trading signals, manages risk, and executes orders.
6. **Monitoring and Maintenance Layer**: Provides real-time monitoring, alerts, and periodic retraining.

## How to Use

1. **Data Collection**: Run the scripts in the `data_collection` directory to collect various types of data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Use the scripts in the `data_preprocessing` directory to clean and prepare your data.
3. **Data Storage**: Choose between database and file-based storage options in the `data_storage` directory.
4. **Algorithm Training**: Train your models using the scripts in the `algorithm_training` directory.
5. **Algorithm Execution**: Execute trades using the scripts in the `algorithm_execution` directory.
6. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Use the scripts in the `monitoring_maintenance` directory for ongoing management.

## Note

- Modify the scripts as per your specific requirements and trading strategies.
